# BugReport

This is a simple website I created to teach myself Reactjs.
Right now this uses Nodejs with express to create a simple REST API to get information from the
backend to the front-end. It will eventually use MySQL and a form of Authentication to GET and POST
data via the REST API, but for now it uses hard-coded data.
